    Know then on Minos III sacred to Mars
    do grow the spawn of Cadmus from afar

    as towers tall, monoliths for Clotho
    to spread as she would. The Xarci Bedo

    we call this foe. Do you now seek the stone
    below of Dragon born to call your own?

This is a terminal-based roguelike. Assuming that the development tools,
perl, App::cpanminus, and possibly also local::lib are installed and
setup, in a suitable terminal install and run the game via:

    cpanm Game::Xomb
    xomb


There is some documentation about the game:

    perldoc Game::Xomb


For the source code, see:

https://github.com/thrig/Game-Xomb


This can be built and installed (with dependencies) by running:

    git clone https://github.com/thrig/Game-Xomb
    cd Game-Xomb
    cpanm .

or without dependencies the manual old fashioned way:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

and new releases may be authored along the lines of:

    git tag -u ... -s
    git push github master
    RELEASE_TESTING=1 TEST_SIGNATURE=1 ./Build disttest
    gzip --best Game-Xomb-...
    cpan-upload ...

listed here as I am forever forgetting the exact commands.
