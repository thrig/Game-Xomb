    Know then on Minos III sacred to Mars
    do grow the spawn of Cadmus from afar

    as towers tall, monoliths for Clotho
    to spread as she would. The Xarci Bedo

    we call this foe. Do you now seek the stone
    below of Dragon born to call your own?

Xomb is a terminal-based roguelike. Assuming that the development tools,
perl, App::cpanminus, and possibly also local::lib are installed and
setup, in a suitable terminal install and run the game via:

    cpanm Game::Xomb
    xomb

NOTE the 7DRL 2020 version is 1.00; anything released after that is
post-challenge fixes and improvements. The 7DRL version may be
installed via:

    cpanm JMATES/Game-Xomb-1.00.tar.gz


Documentation is available in xomb(1) or by running:

    perldoc xomb


For the source code, see:

https://github.com/thrig/Game-Xomb


This can be built and installed (chasing dependencies):

    git clone https://github.com/thrig/Game-Xomb
    cd Game-Xomb
    cpanm .

or without dependencies the manual old fashioned way:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

and new releases may be authored along the lines of:

    git tag -u ... -s v...
    git push github master
    RELEASE_TESTING=1 TEST_SIGNATURE=1 ./Build disttest
    RELEASE_TESTING=1 TEST_SIGNATURE=1 ./Build dist
    cpan-upload ...
    ./Build realclean

If the same directory is shared between different systems the build tree
may need to be rebuilt:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build realclean
