    * simplify reify as only needs operate on MINERAL
    * some XS cleanups

1.02    2020-03-19 16:15 UTC
    * only check for passive effects on MINERAL not also VEGGIE.
      simplify the passive_* calls a bit
    * remove unused load_map()
    * report Amulet proximity after any environmental effects
    * rework scoring function to use exact AMULET value, more points for
      visiting deeper levels, more points if actually win
    * tests of more of the code, and fix various broken tests
    * tweak gems and some other things too

1.01    2020-03-14 03:25 UTC
    * switch RNG to Jenkins Small Fast -- "A small noncryptographic PRNG"
    * save keystrokes to file and support replay from that
    * cleanup map generation logic. now possible for gems to
      generate on top of gates, in acid, monsters atop rubble, the
      player in acid, etc
    * add some map generation sanity tests (t/mapgen.t)
    * custom features for (the optional) level 5 instead of simply
      duplicating level 4 (L5 is now more difficult)
    * rework Fungi due to $iters and distance() differences; Fungi
      splash confines itself to FOV; Fungi cannot zap through walls
    * various other fixes, improvements, and regressions

    * bugfix: remove debug logfile redirect

    * make Fungi more relevant by having them camp resources
    * Stalkers get = for shots so they can be distinguished from Railgun
      or Gatling fire
    * update_* cleanups to remove old/duplicate variables and thus fix
      and create some old and new bugs
    * try to only delay the game if the player is hit or something
      visible happens in the FOV
    * various other fixes, improvements, and regressions
